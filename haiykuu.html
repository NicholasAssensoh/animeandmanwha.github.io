      <h3>What is Haikyuu?</h3>
      <p>Haikyuu is a Japanese sports manga and anime about volleyball that began in February 2012 to July 2020, written and illustrated by Haruichi Furudate.

      <h1>Why Do I Like Haikyuu?</h1>
      <h3>The Realism</h3>
      <p>Haikyuu holds a special place in my heart because of the realistic moments within the series, and the moments most grounded in reality. There are many highs and lows, as there is with all sports, and the way the characters bond and act and react with each other during the highs and lows feels genuine. I play volleyball in real life and watching the show is like a breath of fresh air, because it can be exagerrated sometimes but it also has some extremely real moments. Haikyuu compels you to ask yourself "who will you be tomorrow?" and encourages you to jump higher and look for new ways to fly in your life. Below is a clip from the series where the main protagonist and his team, Karasuno, get the final point against the main antagonist group, Aoba Johsai, by displaying immense teamwork and flying higher than they ever have, surpassing their limits in a dramatic finish.</p>
