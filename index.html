    <h1>What Makes The God of Highschool Special</h1>
    <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
    <p>If there's anything iconic about GoH, it's the various martial arts and fighting styles featured in the
      collective 570 chapters. This includes, but is not limited to, kokushin karate, taekwondo, taekkyon, muay thai,
      and many more. As it is an action comic the fights are the juiciest parts of the series. One of the best example
      of GoH's high-octane fights is below, as Jin Mori faces off against the deuteragonist Han Daewi. The following
      clip is from the anime adaptation of The God of Highschool, animated by Studio Mappa. </p>
